# Question: How do you sort an array where each element is at most k positions away from its sorted position? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a solution to sort an array where each element is at most k positions away from its sorted position. It uses a data structure called a priority queue, which is implemented as a binary heap. The priority queue is initialized with a comparator function that determines the order of the elements. The first k+1 elements of the array are pushed into the priority queue. Then, the smallest element is popped from the priority queue and the next element from the array is pushed into the queue. This process is repeated until all elements in the array have been processed. After that, all remaining elements in the priority queue are popped and placed into the array. The result is a sorted array. This solution works because the priority queue always keeps the smallest element at the top, and since each element is at most k positions away from its sorted position, the smallest element will always be within the first k+1 elements. Therefore, by continuously popping the smallest element and pushing the next element, the array is sorted.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version in terms of the overall approach to solving the problem. Both versions use a priority queue to maintain a sliding window of size `k + 1` while traversing the array, and both versions use the same logic to push and pop elements from the priority queue and put them in their correct positions in the array.

However, there are a few differences between the two versions:

1. Type Annotations: The TypeScript version includes type annotations, which provide a way to enforce certain types of values. For example, the `push` method in the `PriorityQueue` class has a parameter `val` of type `number`, and the `sortK` function has parameters `arr` of type `number[]` and `k` of type `number`. These type annotations help to catch errors at compile time.

2. Private Members: The TypeScript version uses the `private` keyword to declare private members of the `PriorityQueue` class. These members cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. This feature provides a way to encapsulate the internal state of the class and prevent it from being manipulated directly.

3. Optional Chaining: The TypeScript version uses optional chaining (`end !== undefined`) in the `pop` method to handle the case where the `pop` method of an array returns `undefined`. This feature provides a way to handle potential `undefined` values in a safe way.

4. Different Implementation of Priority Queue: The JavaScript version uses a comparator function to determine the order of elements in the priority queue, while the TypeScript version uses a binary heap implementation without a comparator function. The binary heap implementation in the TypeScript version is simpler and more efficient, but it assumes that the elements in the queue are numbers and that the queue is a max heap.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses the same logic as the JavaScript version. Both versions use a priority queue (min heap) to sort the array. They first push the first k+1 elements into the priority queue. Then they pop the smallest element from the priority queue and push the next element from the array into the priority queue. They repeat this process until all elements in the array have been processed. Finally, they pop all remaining elements from the priority queue and put them into the array. The result is a sorted array.

However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in the two versions:

1. In the JavaScript version, a PriorityQueue class is manually implemented with methods like push, pop, peek, etc. In the C++ version, the STL (Standard Template Library) provides a priority_queue that is used, which already has these methods implemented.

2. The JavaScript version uses a comparator function in the PriorityQueue class to determine the order of elements in the queue. In the C++ version, the order is determined by using the std::greater template, which is passed as a parameter to the priority_queue.

3. The JavaScript version uses the length property to get the size of the array, while the C++ version uses the size() method.

4. The JavaScript version uses console.log to print the sorted array, while the C++ version uses std::cout.

5. The JavaScript version uses the array destructuring feature to swap elements in the _swap method. The C++ version doesn't need to implement a swap method because it uses the top() and pop() methods of priority_queue to remove the smallest element.

6. The JavaScript version uses a for...of loop to iterate over the array, while the C++ version uses a range-based for loop.

7. The JavaScript version uses the push method to add elements to the array, while the C++ version uses the push_back method.
